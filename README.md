# Being a noob

I currently consider myself a noob and my goal is to learn as many computing related skills as possible. I am very willing to create interesting and cool projects along the way. 

**A little bit about me:**

- 🏫 I'm an IB Diploma Year 1 student in Shanghai, China
- 🎯 My dream university is Carnegie Mellon University, so I'm working hard to get there
- 🌍 I want to connect with other awesome coders and share my experiences
- 🎨 I study visual arts, and I am currently working on my arts portfolio

**My plan for this year:**

- 📚 Learn multiple programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++
- 💻 Build fun and creative projects
- 🌟 Collaborate with other developers and contribute to open-source projects

Please feel free to check out my repositories and follow my progress
