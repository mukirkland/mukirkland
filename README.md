# Being a noob

I'm currently in the exploration phase and my goal is to learn as many computing related skills as possible this year. I'm also really excited about creating interesting and cool projects along the way. 

**A little bit about me:**

- 🏫 I'm an IB Diploma Year 1 student in Shanghai, China
- 🎯 My dream university is Carnegie Mellon University, so I'm working hard to get there
- 🌍 I want to connect with other awesome coders and share my experiences

**My plan for this year:**

- 📚 Learn multiple programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++
- 💻 Build fun and creative projects to show off my skills
- 🌟 Collaborate with other developers and contribute to open-source projects

Please feel free to check out my repositories and follow my progress
